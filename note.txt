in react state means data.

css - we mainly use css in one files.

when we need a reactive/dynamic value we use usestate hook.

we use props when we pass data frome parents component to child component

useeffect hook => it renders a function when rendering happens.

the first parameter of a useeffect hook is a function and the second parameter of  useeffect hook is dependency array.

the dependency array contains those states whose changes invoke the funtion.

useeffect is used for fetch data.

conditional templating is cool.

for creating json-server
npx json-server@latest --watch data/db.json --port 8000

.then(receive the actual data)
.catch(catch mainly network error)
for other error we mainly define them by this
 = throw Error('this is an error');

 we can create custom hook for using that logic later.



 single page application is a common use case for react.
 Normally the server sends index.html to the client.
 but in react server send index.html + js bundle(which we call component)
 
 npm install react-router-dom@5

 instead of anchor tag(a), we use Link in for linking.

write a cleanuup function in useeffect use abortcontroller.its abort fetching data.

useHistory hook helps to redirect to a specific route.
